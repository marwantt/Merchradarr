      <h1>How to Use MerchRadar (Step by Step Guide)</h1>

      <p>
        If you are a <strong>Merch by Amazon seller</strong> or Print on Demand
        designer, niche research is one of the hardest parts of the job. 
        MerchRadar is a free and simple tool that helps you
        <em> find profitable keywords, discover new trends, and validate niches</em> 
        for <strong>t-shirts, hoodies, and sweatshirts</strong> on Amazon.
      </p>

      <h2>Why MerchRadar?</h2>
      <p>

        <strong>Merch on Demand products</strong>. This means:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>No more scrolling through random FBA products.</li>
        <li>Direct access to <strong>novelty and graphic tees</strong>.</li>
        <li>Search across multiple marketplaces (US, UK, DE, FR).</li>
        <li>Quickly validate niches before you design.</li>
      </ul>
