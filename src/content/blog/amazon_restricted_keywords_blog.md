# Amazon Restricted Keywords: The Ultimate Guide for Merch by Amazon Sellers

If you’re selling on **Merch by Amazon**, your success doesn’t just depend on great designs — it also depends on **compliant listings**. Many sellers face frustrating rejections because of restricted keywords. These rules apply across **all niches**, whether you’re designing for fishing, gaming, AI, sports, or any other theme.

In this post, we’ll break down Amazon’s restricted keyword policies, the words you must avoid, and safe alternatives you can use.

## 🚫 Why Amazon Restricts Certain Keywords

Amazon’s main goal is to protect customers from misleading, exaggerated, or low-quality listings. That means your **titles, bullets, and descriptions** must stay clean and descriptive.

Amazon flags:
- **Promotional claims** (*best seller, free shipping, new product, 100% quality guaranteed*).  
- **Subjective terms** (*perfect, great for, high quality*).  
- **Medical/health claims** (*cure, safe, eco-friendly, natural, organic*).  
- **Amazon-specific references** (*Amazon choice, top rated*).  

If you use these words, your design risks:
- ❌ Rejection or delisting  
- ❌ Suppressed search visibility  
- ❌ Account warnings or suspensions

## ✅ Safe Alternatives You Can Use

Instead of using restricted words, reframe your listing with **neutral descriptive language**:

- Replace *“perfect gift for anglers”* → **“designed for anglers and outdoor lovers”**  
- Replace *“great for birthdays”* → **“suitable for birthdays and Father’s Day”**  
- Replace *“best fishing shirt”* → **“retro fishing themed design”**  
- Replace *“high quality print”* → **(remove entirely, Amazon handles quality)**  

This way, your listings stay **SEO-rich and compliant**.

## 🔑 Amazon Listing Best Practices (2025)

- **Titles (3–60 chars):** Neutral, descriptive, keyword-rich. No hype words.  
- **Bullets (≤256 chars each):** Always fill the space with audience, use case, and emotional meaning — but avoid banned terms.  
- **Description (75–2000 chars):** Tell the story of the design. Who it’s for, why it matters, when to wear it. Stay descriptive, not promotional.  
- **Brand Name (3–50 chars):** Consistent across designs, niche-focused.
