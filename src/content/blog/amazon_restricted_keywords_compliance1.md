# Amazon Restricted Keywords: The Ultimate Guide for Merch by Amazon Sellers

![Amazon Restricted Keywords Visual Guide](/images/blog/amazon-restricted-keywords.png)

If you're selling on **Merch by Amazon**, your success doesn't just depend on great designs — it also depends on **compliant listings**. Many sellers face frustrating rejections because of restricted keywords. These rules apply across **all niches**, whether you're designing for fishing, gaming, AI, sports, or any other theme.

## 🚫 Why Amazon Restricts Certain Keywords

Amazon’s main goal is to protect customers from misleading, exaggerated, or low-quality listings. That means your **titles, bullets, and descriptions** must stay clean and descriptive.

Amazon flags:
- **Promotional claims** (*best seller, free shipping, new product, 100% quality guaranteed*).  
- **Subjective terms** (*perfect, great for, high quality*).  
- **Medical/health claims** (*cure, safe, eco-friendly, natural, organic*).  
- **Amazon-specific references** (*Amazon choice, top rated*).  

If you use these words, your design risks:
- ❌ Rejection or delisting  
- ❌ Suppressed search visibility  
- ❌ Account warnings or suspensions

## ✅ Safe Alternatives You Can Use

Instead of using restricted words, reframe your listing with **neutral descriptive language**:

- Replace *“perfect gift for anglers”* → **“designed for anglers and outdoor lovers”**  
- Replace *“great for birthdays”* → **“suitable for birthdays and Father’s Day”**  
- Replace *“best fishing shirt”* → **“retro fishing themed design”**  
- Replace *“high quality print”* → **(remove entirely, Amazon handles quality)**  

This way, your listings stay **SEO-rich and compliant**.

## 🔑 Amazon Listing Best Practices (2025)

- **Titles (3–60 chars):** Neutral, descriptive, keyword-rich. No hype words.  
- **Bullets (≤256 chars each):** Always fill the space with audience, use case, and emotional meaning — but avoid banned terms.  
- **Description (75–2000 chars):** Tell the story of the design. Who it’s for, why it matters, when to wear it. Stay descriptive, not promotional.  
- **Brand Name (3–50 chars):** Consistent across designs, niche-focused.
