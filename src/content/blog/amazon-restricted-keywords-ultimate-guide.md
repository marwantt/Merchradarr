## 🚨 Why Amazon Restricts Keywords

Amazon's primary goal is **protecting customers** from misleading, exaggerated, or low-quality listings. Your titles, bullets, and descriptions must stay clean and descriptive.

### ⛔ Amazon Flags These Categories:

| 🔴 **Category** | **Examples** | **Risk Level** |
|:----------------|:-------------|:---------------|
| **Promotional Claims** | "best seller", "free shipping", "100% guaranteed" | 🔥 **Critical** |
| **Subjective Terms** | "perfect", "great for", "high quality" | 🟧 **High** |
| **Medical Claims** | "cure", "safe", "eco-friendly", "natural" | 🔥 **Critical** |
| **Amazon References** | "Amazon choice", "top rated" | 🟧 **High** |

### 💥 The Consequences

If you use restricted words, your design risks:

- ❌ **Immediate listing rejection**
- 📉 **Suppressed search visibility**
- ⚠️ **Account warnings**
- 🚫 **Account suspension**

## ✅ Safe Alternatives That Work

Instead of banned terms, use **neutral descriptive language**:

### 🔄 Smart Replacements

| ❌ **Restricted** | ✅ **Safe Alternative** |
|:------------------|:------------------------|
| "Perfect gift for anglers" | "Designed for anglers and outdoor enthusiasts" |
| "Great for birthdays" | "Suitable for birthdays and Father's Day" |
| "Best fishing shirt" | "Retro fishing themed design" |
| "High quality print" | *(Remove entirely - Amazon handles quality)* |
| "100% guaranteed" | "Classic design" |
| "Top rated seller" | "Popular fishing design" |
| "Amazon's choice" | "Trending outdoor apparel" |

### 💡 **Pro Writing Tips**

1. **Stay Descriptive**: Focus on what the design IS, not how good it is
2. **Use Neutral Language**: Avoid superlatives and marketing speak
3. **Be Specific**: "Vintage bass fishing" vs "perfect fishing gift"
4. **Skip Quality Claims**: Let Amazon and customers judge quality
