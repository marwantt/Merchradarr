      <h1>About MerchRadar</h1>

      <p>
        MerchRadar is a <strong>free research tool</strong> designed specifically for 
        <strong> Merch by Amazon sellers</strong> and Print on Demand entrepreneurs. 
        Our mission is to make niche research faster, easier, and more effective.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Founded by Amazon Merch sellers who experienced the frustration of 
        traditional research methods, MerchRadar was built to solve a simple problem: 
        <em> finding profitable niches shouldn&apos;t take hours</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        We noticed that most sellers were spending countless hours manually searching 
        Amazon, scrolling through irrelevant products, and struggling to identify 
        which listings were actually Merch by Amazon designs. That&apos;s why we 
        created a tool that filters results to show only Merch on Demand products.
      </p>
